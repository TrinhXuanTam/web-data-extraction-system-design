\section{Assignment}

Design (technical document) a system that processes an infinite
stream of data:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Each record comes as a tuple(url, html content)
  \item Extract and store the occurrences of: urls, hosts, top-level-domains, in/out links of the page
\end{itemize}

We have one machine that has enough disk space but limited memory. Write a design document to describe the system architecture and data structures as building blocks.
